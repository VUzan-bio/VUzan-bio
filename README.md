Biologist specializing in immunology and biologics, with practical experience across R&D, GMP process development, and data science in research institutions and large biopharma (Sanofi, Lonza). I build projects that bridge experimental immunology with computational modeling—turning complex biological data (single‑cell, spatial, imaging, organoid‑derived) into predictive systems that guide hypotheses, experiments, and preclinical strategy. I’m also working on Holocyte, a platform aiming to simulate and ultimately replace key parts of in vitro and in vivo testing for oncology biologics.

## Research interests
- ML for biology – graph models, representation learning, and multimodal integration for omics and imaging data.
- Virtual cell & cell–cell interactions – data‑driven modeling of cell states, trajectories, and interaction networks in tissues.
- ML‑enabled drug discovery & biologics engineering – design, optimization, and developability prediction for therapeutic antibodies and other biologics.
- Preclinical translation with ML – biomarker discovery, patient stratification, response prediction, and decision support for preclinical/early‑clinical programs.

## Looking for
I’m looking to pursue a PhD at the intersection of immunology and machine learning, as the next era of biomedical progress will come from building real bridges between biology and computation.

I come from a biology‑first background and have been actively building my quantitative toolkit through independent projects. My goal is to combine deep biological intuition with rigorous computational methods and eventually build a company that uses ML and mechanistic modeling to accelerate the discovery, development, and optimization of biologics.
