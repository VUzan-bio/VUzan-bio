Biologist specializing in immunology and biologics, with practical experience across R&D, GMP process development, and data science in research institutions and large biopharma (Sanofi, Lonza). I build projects that bridge experimental immunology with computational modeling—turning complex biological data (single‑cell, spatial, imaging, organoid‑derived) into predictive systems that guide hypotheses, experiments, and preclinical strategy. I’m also working on Holocyte, a platform aiming to simulate and ultimately replace key parts of in vitro and in vivo testing for oncology biologics.

## Research interests

- ML for biology – graph models, representation learning, and multimodal integration for omics and imaging data.
- Virtual cell & cell–cell interactions – data‑driven modeling of cell states, trajectories, and interaction networks in tissues.
- ML‑enabled drug discovery & biologics engineering – design, optimization, and developability prediction for therapeutic antibodies and other biologics.
- Preclinical translation with ML – biomarker discovery, patient stratification, response prediction, and decision support for preclinical/early‑clinical programs.

## Looking for
I’m seeking a PhD at the intersection of immunology and machine learning, ideally in a lab working on immune trafficking/tissue niches, with strong single-cell/spatial (and optionally imaging) data. I’m biology-first and I’m building depth in quantitative methods through public, reproducible projects; my goal is to contribute immediately with analysis pipelines and, over time, develop models that produce falsifiable hypotheses and improve experimental efficiency.
